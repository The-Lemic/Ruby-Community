#lore

Somewhere over the rough ocean waves, across the burned and blackened landscape of atrata. Through the peachy pink and orange forests of the hinterlands. At the foot of the farcaster peaks sits a small farmstead on a spring evening.

Inside the farmstead a human famer by the name of Morgan is putting his children Sindy and Aaron to bed 

"Come one dad just one story before bed" whine the children

"Fine just one, and then it's lights out... Have you ever heard the story of Arrako the Pure?

Nearly 2000 years back the world was very different to the world we see today, The sky was red not blue and the ocean was black not blue

Demons ruled instead of kings. That was until a young white scaled dragonborn named [[Arrako the Pure]] decided the world had had enough.

He traveled all of [[Darrathen]] in preparation. He trained with the Monks at the mountain peaks, Gathered his allies from all over the land and unravel the mystery of magic to create a trap.

After of years of training Arrako and his allies know as [[The Four]] made a stand against the demon lord [[Orcus]].

They fought fearlessly, launching an attack on Orcus' stronghold in the south. The breached the main gate, fought through the crowds of demons and when they faced the demon lord they faced a grueling fight. They were no match for Orcus' wand of death. In a last ditch moment of desperation they activated their trap.

A massive ball of magical energy expanded, engulfing the stronghold and all with in and in an instant it was all gone. Leaving behind nothing but a shattered barren landscape.

Some say they transported the stronghold to another plane of existence, or beck to the hell from where it came, some say it was a bomb so powerful it left nothing behind.

One thing is for sure [[The Four]] sacrificed themselves to free this world from Orcus. To bring an end to the dark days.

Now I think that's enough for one night"
