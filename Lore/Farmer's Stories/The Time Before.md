#lore 

Before and you. Before Bessie the dog. Before our farm. Before the kingdoms of men. Before the dwarves under the mountains. Before the elvish and their Kingdom. Way back before any of that but not before dragons.

The world was a dark dark place ruled by a demon lord by the name of [[Orcus]]. We all lived under his thumb except the dragons who refused to bow down. They wages a war know as the [[War of the Dragons]], it was futile all attempts stopped dead with a single wave his prize possession [[The Wand Of Orcus]].

Things would stay this way until, in the depths of the dragon pits deep withing [[The Farcaster Peaks]]. Our lord performed a miracle. From a dragons egg hatched our saviour. With the courage of a dragon and the cunning of a man [[Arrako the Pure]] was born.
