For generations, the oppressive reign of Orcus held the land in torment. It wasn't until a fellowship of valiant heroes united to take a stand, pushing back the demon lord and his wicked minions, then sealing the infernal gateway. This fellowship comprised of the noble figures: Arrako the Pure, Faben the Worthy, Cynric the Brave, and Xaverine the Light.

After the demons' expulsion, time flowed onward, and now, 1491 years have passed since those dark days. While Godmere and its neighboring territories have rebounded and prospered, the lands further to the south remain locked in a frigid, desolate embrace. Our tale unfolds a mere half day's journey from the grand capital city of Darrethen, Godmere, in the humble town of Five Points.
