## LeBeau Family

The LeBeau family stands among the most powerful noble houses of [[Godmere]], their wealth and influence built upon a near-total monopoly of black powder production. To the public, [[Lord Javier LeBeau]] is a calculating industrial magnate, ruling from his factories along the [[Fabenward|docks]], while [[Lady Amelie LeBeau]] (herself born of an elite horse-breeding dynasty tied to old noble blood) embodies refinement and tradition. Privately, the family is bound to [[The Ghostwalkers]], a secret society they helped found generations ago, an organization that values obedience, secrecy, and ritual above all else. Every child of House LeBeau is expected to serve the society, undergoing ceremonies that bind them to its purpose: the daughters as Sirens, the sons as Reapers.

[[Benny LeBeau]] was the exception, and the shame. Born with the mark of the [[Everflame]], he was deemed too dangerous to indoctrinate and too valuable to execute. Rather than risk the society's wrath, [[Lord Javier LeBeau|Javier]] arranged for Benny's quiet banishment from the city, erasing his presence while keeping his survival a closely guarded secret. In his absence, Benny's sisters ([[Annette LeBeau|Annette]], [[Bethany LeBeau|Bethany]], and [[Claire LeBeau|Claire]]) fulfilled their roles without question, and his youngest brother [[Danton LeBeau|Danton]] now stands on the brink of his own Reaper ceremony. Officially, Benny is spoken of as a failure, a disappointment who lacked the discipline to serve. In truth, his whereabouts over the past several years remain one of the family's most dangerous secrets. Torn between a longing for his parents' approval and a growing rejection of the society that would have destroyed him, Benny exists as a living contradiction, proof that the LeBeau legacy is not as unbreakable as it claims to be.

## History

### The Black Powder Dynasty

The family fortune goes back decades. When simple farmer Jean Paul LeBeau's crops failed to bring yield, he had to look elsewhere for wealth. People thought he was mad for banking on the barren wastelands of [[Atrata]], making a deal and purchasing the land for what everyone thought was an absurd amount for nothing. He spent his whole life dedicated to finding a use for the strange residue from the wastelands.

It wasn't until his final days that one of his experiments came to fruition, creating a powerful explosive material: black powder. Since the family owns the land and no one else has access to the main ingredient, the LeBeaus maintain an absolute monopoly on black powder production. This monopoly has brought them immense fortune and favor with the most powerful people in the kingdom.

### Connection to The Ghostwalkers

The LeBeau family is one of the founding families of [[The Ghostwalkers]] secret society. Through this organization, they wield influence far beyond their commercial success, with family members serving in key roles:

- **Daughters** undergo [[The Fold]] ceremony to become **Sirens**: rogues who manipulate high court politics, sow rumors, and conduct espionage
- **Sons** undergo [[The Fold]] ceremony to become **Reapers**: warlocks who conduct assassinations, theft, and handle the society's darkest work

This dual role as industrial magnates and shadow operatives makes the LeBeau family one of the most dangerous houses in [[Godmere]].

## Family Members

### [[Lord Javier LeBeau]]
Patriarch of the family and public face of the black powder empire. A calculating businessman who rules his commercial interests with an iron fist while maintaining the family's deepest secrets. Made the difficult decision to exile his son [[Benny LeBeau|Benny]] rather than see him killed or allow him to expose the family.

### [[Lady Amelie LeBeau]]
Matriarch of the family, born of an elite horse-breeding dynasty with ancient noble lineage. Embodies the refinement and tradition expected of high society while being fully complicit in the family's connection to [[The Ghostwalkers]].

### [[Benny LeBeau]]
The family's greatest shame and most dangerous secret. Born with the mark of the [[Everflame]], Benny was deemed unsuitable for [[The Fold]] ceremony and banished from [[Godmere]]. His survival and whereabouts are closely guarded secrets. Currently adventuring with [[The Stumblers]].

### [[Annette LeBeau]]
Eldest daughter. Successfully underwent [[The Fold]] ceremony and serves as a Siren in [[The Ghostwalkers]], fulfilling her role without question.

### [[Bethany LeBeau]]

### [[Danton LeBeau]]
Youngest son. Currently stands on the brink of his own Reaper ceremony, preparing to follow in his father's footsteps and join the male branch of [[The Ghostwalkers]].

## LeBeau Holdings

### Godmere Town House
Primary residence of the LeBeau family in [[Godmere]].

### Black Powder Factories
Every major port has a LeBeau factory outpost where black powder is stored and distributed. The largest concentration of these facilities is in [[Fabenward]], [[Godmere]]'s waterfront district.

### Atrata Mining Facility
In the barren black landscape of [[Atrata]], a small mining facility operates continuously, extracting the unique ingredient necessary for black powder production. This remote operation is the source of the family's monopoly and wealth.
