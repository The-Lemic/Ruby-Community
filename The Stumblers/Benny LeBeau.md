## LeBeau Family
The LeBeau family stands among the most powerful noble houses of the city, their wealth and influence built upon a near-total monopoly of black powder. To the public, Viscount Javier LeBeau is a calculating industrial magnate, ruling from his factories along the docks, while Lady Amelie LeBeau—herself born of an elite horse-breeding dynasty tied to old noble blood—embodies refinement and tradition. Privately, the family is bound to a secret society they helped found generations ago, an organization that values obedience, secrecy, and ritual above all else. Every child of House LeBeau is expected to serve the society, undergoing ceremonies that bind them to its purpose: the daughters as Sirens, the sons as Reapers.

Benny LeBeau was the exception—and the shame. Born with the mark of the Everflame, he was deemed too dangerous to indoctrinate and too valuable to execute. Rather than risk the society’s wrath, Javier arranged for Benny’s quiet banishment from the city, erasing his presence while keeping his survival a closely guarded secret. In his absence, Benny’s sisters—Annette, Bethany, and Claire—fulfilled their roles without question, and his youngest brother Danton now stands on the brink of his own Reaper ceremony. Officially, Benny is spoken of as a failure, a disappointment who lacked the discipline to serve. In truth, his whereabouts over the past several years remain one of the family’s most dangerous secrets. Torn between a longing for his parents’ approval and a growing rejection of the society that would have destroyed him, Benny exists as a living contradiction—proof that the LeBeau legacy is not as unbreakable as it claims to be.

### Black powder dynasty
The family fortune goes back decades. When a simple farmers crops didnt bring yield. Jean Paul LeBeau had to look elsewhere for wealth. People thought he was mad for banking on the barren wastelands of Atrata. Making a deal and purchasing the land for what everyone thought was an absurd amount for nothing he spent his whole life dedicated trying to find a use for the leftovers from the wastelands. It wasn't until his final days where one of his experiments came to fruition creating a powerful explosive material. Since the family own the land and no one else has access to the main ingredient for the black powder. The family had a monopoly on the source and gained fortune and favour with the most powerful of people.
