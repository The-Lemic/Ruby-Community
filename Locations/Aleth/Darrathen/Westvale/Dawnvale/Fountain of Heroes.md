#Location 
## Description
A fountain dedicated to [[The Four]] - the heroes who saved the world from [[Orcus]] during [[The Dark Age]]. The fountain originally featured four statues representing each hero, but [[Zog Ironheart]] destroyed the statue of [[Xaverine the Light]] in a fit of rage, making the dial puzzle more challenging for visitors trying to identify all four heroes.

The remaining statues show:
- [[Arrako the Pure]] 
- [[Faben the Worthy]]
- [[Cynric the Brave]]

The destroyed statue's base remains, with only fragments suggesting it once depicted an elf with a mace, but the identifying features have been obliterated.
