### Description

Inside is candle lit, Statue to Chauntea. There is a Religious leader [[Rosamund Beckwith]] 

Outside of the Shrine is a [[Godfrey the mad man]], The man has no name, he is missing an arm. and dressed in rags sat on the floor, He's ranting about not worshiping a god that does nothing. and says to step back to the old ways of worshiping the old gods you should pay tribute to [[Order of the New Dawn (Cult of Orcus)]]

New light to shine on your darkest days

Quote from the church woman 

The Earthmother is everything, and her health is our health. She feeds us, clothes us, waters us, and shelters us. No god is greater than her, though many are noisier. No god is more forgiving, more nurturing, or more essential. Truly, Chauntea is All.

Rosamund will notice the necklace of [[Bronn]] It will be a necklace of the shades.
