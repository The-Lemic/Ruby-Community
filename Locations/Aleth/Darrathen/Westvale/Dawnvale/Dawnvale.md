#Location

**Dawnvale** is a peaceful sea-side farming town nestled between rolling hills and quiet woods. With no palisade walls, its open fields and cobblestone paths speak to a life of calm routine. At the townâ€™s heart stands a stone fountain with statues of folk heroes, ~~One statue lies shattered in the water, in the middle of the fountain sits an iron stove lying half-submerged in the water.~~

On the north side of the square, the towns general store, the window displays a collection of items for every day use that the townsfolk are perusing.

To the south, boarding the town square a large stocky blacksmith with a poor constructed combover is mending a piece of armour for some customers. The strikes on the anvil echoing in the air.

To the west of the town square a largish manor house, suddenly the ground floor wall of the manor explodes outward, a large metal stove is flung from the building in a cloud of dust. It sails threw the air and collides with a statue on the fountain reducing it to rubble in a clash. The hunk of metal comes to rest in the centre of the fountain.

Turning back to the manor, the dust settles for you to see a large hole into the kitchen of the house, a large orc sobbing on his knees in his kitchen.
