Rooms

  

1. The Mirror room, There are three mirrors in this room, the middle one is panicked and doesn't know what to do but will talk to you. The reflection tells you that the reflections have fallen out and that one doesn't want to help strangers and the other does. But you can only talk to one of them. If they see you talking to their enemy then they wont even look at you
2. This room is filled with purple silk curtains and crystal chandeliers in the corner sits a large yellow cannon. Players with the circus background will recognise this to big part of the circus act that burnt down outside of five points a couple of months back.
3. This room is has a rhino in its and in the rafters a saber toothed tiger waits

5. This is a bedroom, it is very cluttered and on the table in the corner there is a giant eagle. Half of it has been plucked. Arcana check of 14 (must be proficient) This is one of the ingredients of a polymorph potion
6. Remnants of a burnt down house, very strange. Roll a DC15 History Check
7. A dark empty room with scratched around the doors. Inside there is a crazy clown who is covered in blood holding a knife. The surviving clown has eaten the others. His name is Loko and the others were called Lala and Loof. The clown is crying and will attack anyone who is within 10 meters.
  
9. Room of crates with caged animals, they all seem broken and dont wait to make eye contact. Theres a panther in the corner. Animal handling check of DC16 to calm the panther in the cage. Will then leave if being let out. And either eat or drink the blood of the clown.
10. The Alter room in here is the main area of the den, Sitting on the alter sipping from the chalice of eternal life is Cicero The Ringmaster. He is seems very casual about you showing up at his house and says something like who are you, what do you want. He then tries to come to some sort of arrangement for the chalice. He offers to trade the chalice just for the days use. In exchange for three of the adventures. He show them to the cages that they will be kept in. Here there is also children in cages in that seem to have been mixed with animals. Theres a lemur, and a child who is half human half Boa constrictor. He looks in pain but hisses softly when someone says henry.

Loko The Clown

Bite +3 to hit. Reach 5th, one target Loko can do 1D6 biting damage and heal by that amount.

Arriving at this place you will find a wall that the compass points towards. And arcana check of DC16 will show its an illusion.

An investigation check of DC18 will show that people have passed through

Speaking the children looking at the street will tell you that they have seen a man drag their friend Henry into the wall a couple on nights ago, there waiting with slingshots to get him.

The Plan

  

Start up in the room with the panther

  

Friendly chat (let them go, no fight very weak, Heal = fight)

  

Go out to the cages (see the water bowls of potions)

  

Go up the stairs see posters. (devil child, strong man, bearded lady etc)

  

Cicero happy to see Nova.

  

Where has Nova been?

  

I'm rebuilding the circus with street rats. It's what the humans deserve. I wasnâ€™t shown love and care..

  

When it's time, casually sip from the chalice.

  

Then when things heat up notice Frank von strip. Ask him if he's back for more, then dispel the illusion

  

Frank flash back when he sees the cannon
