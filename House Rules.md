#### Player responsibility

Write what your character looks like, hair colour, eye colour ect.

Keep your spell slots, ammunition and rations available

#### Realism rules
##### Spell casting
When you pick a spell caster You will need to cast spells from your spell casting focus or material components. 
We can decide of new spells require material components.
Material components with a gold cost are always required for the spells.

Ammunition
Players with range weapons will have to use ammunition, at the end of an encounter you can collect half of the arrows used.

Food
Players will have to consume food every time they rest. If they do not consume food then will gain exhaustion

Resting

Short rests
There's are 10-30 Min rests where you have enough time to drink some water, eat some food and collect yourself. You must be away from enemy's and in a safe location. All players must rest together.

Long rests
Minimum 10hours
Each PC must sleep 8 hours
Each PC must eat a meal
In unsecured locations encounters will be rolled every 4 hours
Interrupted sleep will still be a long rest however the party will gain level of exhaustion.

Exhaustion
You gain exhaustion one person day that you do not eat or are sick. Resting covers exhaustion 
Levels
1. Disadvantage on ability checks
2. Speed halved
3. Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4. Hit point maximum halved
5. Speed reduced to 0
6. Death

Weight/Coin weight
I tend to ignore weight unless your carrying a crazy amount of stuff

Roleplaying bonus
The benefit of roleplaying is lower DC on roles. If you act out how you would lockpick a door the DC will be slightly lower as reward. Describing your attack will deal slightly more damage.

Heroic Inspiration
This will be given for good roleplaying, and characters personal moments. It's a good reason to write down personal goals.

Instant death
I don't like the original rule for this so hav changed it slightly

When damage reduces you to O hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum + **15hp**
